# README

This is a Rails API app used to manage companies a user is affiliated with.

## Getting Started

1. You will need Ruby 3.2.2 and Rails 7.1.2 installed to run this exercise.
2. Load schema and seeds into the database: `rails db:setup`
3. You are provided with a base set of tests you can run with `rails spec`

You are provided with some sample data also in the [db/seeds.rb](db/seeds.rb) file if you wish to use it.


## Requirements

This is a pairing exercise. Your interviewers will provide you with instructions on each step of the interview.
You may use any search engines, references or tools you need.
If you choose, you may add any gems that you would like to use. Be sure to mention them at the beginning of the interview.
We are here to help and provide pointers. There are no trick questions. Code as you would
when pairing with any colleague.

This app provides the following API endpoints to manipulate `users`, `companies`, and user membership in companies. Run `rails routes` to see available routes.

There is also a project model that is not exposed in any endpoints right now.
